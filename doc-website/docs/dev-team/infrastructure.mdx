# Infrastructure


**Overview**
-----------------

This document provides an overview of the cloud infrastructure used by [Your Company Name] for hosting [Application/Service Name]. The infrastructure is built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and deployed using AWS CDK in TypeScript.

**Components**
---------------

### **Storage**

* **S3 Buckets**: Two S3 buckets are used to store static assets and data.
	+ `asset-bucket`: Used for storing static assets such as images, videos, and documents. This bucket is configured with a lifecycle policy to automatically delete expired objects after 30 days.
	+ `data-bucket`: Used for storing structured data such as databases and logs. This bucket is configured with a server-side encryption (SSE) using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

### **Compute**

* **EC2 Instances**: Not used in this architecture.

### **Networking**

* **VPC**: A VPC is created to define the virtual network for our infrastructure.
	+ The VPC has two subnets: `subnet1` and `subnet2`.
* **Security Groups**: Two security groups are used to control incoming and outgoing traffic:
	+ `sg-asset`: Allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet to the asset bucket.
	+ `sg-data`: Allows internal communication between services and data access from the VPC.

### **Deployments**

* **AWS CDK**: The infrastructure is deployed using AWS CDK in TypeScript. The `app.ts` file contains the main application code, which includes the definitions for all resources such as S3 buckets, subnets, security groups, etc.
* **CloudFormation Stack**: An AWS CloudFormation stack is created to manage the deployment and updates of the infrastructure.

**Security Considerations**
---------------------------

### **Access Control**

* **IAM Roles**: Two IAM roles are used to control access to the resources:
	+ `asset-role`: Used for accessing the asset bucket.
	+ `data-role`: Used for accessing the data bucket.
* **Key Management Service (KMS)**: KMS is used to encrypt and decrypt data stored in S3.

### **Network Security**

* **Firewall Rules**: Firewalls rules are set up to restrict incoming traffic to only necessary ports.

**Best Practices**
-----------------

### **Backup and Recovery**

* Regular backups are taken of all resources using AWS Backup.
* Disaster recovery procedures are implemented to quickly recover from failures.

### **Monitoring**

* Monitoring is set up for key metrics such as CPU usage, disk space utilization, etc.
* Alerts are triggered when thresholds are exceeded or unusual activity is detected.
