# Tools at Novaa Tech

Presentation of all used tools / software at Novaa Tech.

## Ticket Tracking and Project Management System

We use a combination of tools to track tickets and manage our projects. The main components of this system include:

1. **Slack**: Our primary communication platform for team members, clients, and stakeholders.
2. **Linear**: A ticket tracking and project management tool that syncs with our Github repository.
3. **Github**: Our version control system for managing code and collaborating on projects.

## How the System Works

Here's an overview of how these tools work together to facilitate efficient ticket tracking and project management:

1. **Tickets are created in Linear**: When a new issue or bug is discovered, a team member creates a ticket in Linear with relevant details such as summary, description, priority, and assignee.
2. **Tickets are synced with Github**: Each ticket in Linear is automatically synced with the corresponding issue or pull request in Github.
3. **Communication happens in Slack**: Team members discuss tickets in Slack channels dedicated to specific projects or components. This allows for real-time communication and collaboration among team members.
4. **Status updates are reflected in Linear and Github**: As progress is made on a ticket, status updates are reflected in both Linear and Github.

## Key Features and Benefits

Here are some key features and benefits of our ticket tracking and project management system:

* **Unified view of tickets and projects**: Linear provides a single interface for viewing all tickets, regardless of their source (e.g., Slack, email).
* **Real-time collaboration**: Team members can discuss tickets in real-time using Slack channels.
* **Efficient issue resolution**: Status updates are automatically reflected across all tools, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
* **Integrations with Github**: Tickets and pull requests are synced, allowing for seamless code review and merge.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Here's a summary of roles and responsibilities related to ticket tracking and project management:

* **Team members**: Create tickets in Linear, participate in discussions on Slack, and update status as necessary.
* **Project managers**: Monitor progress, provide guidance, and ensure alignment with project goals and objectives.
* **Developers**: Implement fixes or new features as described in tickets, ensuring they are properly synced with Github.
